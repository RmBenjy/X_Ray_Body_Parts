 ## X-Ray Image Classification with Python

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to building an image classification model using Python. The model is trained on a dataset of X-ray images and can be used to predict the class of a new image.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to install the following libraries:

* Python 3.6 or later
* TensorFlow 2.0 or later
* Keras 2.3 or later
* NumPy
* Pandas


### Step 1: Import the Necessary Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import models, layers
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset

The next step is to load the dataset. The dataset is a collection of images, each of which is labeled with its class.


### Step 3: Build the Model

The next step is to build the model. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with three convolutional layers, three max pooling layers, one flatten layer and two dense layers.
