 ## Image Classification with Python: A Comprehensive Guide

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to building an image classification model using Python. The model is trained on a dataset of images and can be used to predict the class of a new image.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to install the following libraries:

* Python 3.6 or later
* TensorFlow 2.0 or later
* Keras 2.3 or later
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

### Step 1: Import the Necessary Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import models, layers
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset

The next step is to load the dataset. The dataset is a collection of images, each of which is labeled with its class.

```python
# Load the dataset from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2)

# Create generators for the training and test sets
train_generator = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255).flow_from_dataframe(
    train_df,
    directory=None,
    x_col='Image',
    y_col='Class',
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical'
)

test_generator = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255).flow_from_dataframe(
    test_df,
    directory=None,
    x_col='Image',
    y_col='Class',
    target_size=(224, 224),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical'
)
```

### Step 3: Build the Model

The next step is to build the model. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with four convolutional layers and two fully connected layers.

```python
# Create the model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='
